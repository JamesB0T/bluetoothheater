Thank you ??? for your interest.
Yes I do have some units ready to sell.

I have two possibilities:
1/ the controller as you can currently view in the GitLab repo.
This would be supplied as is without a case.
2/ a newer version that will be housed in a case.
It will also provide a few conditioned I/O expansion lines:
2 digital inputs, 2 digital outputs, 1 analogue input.
The software is still yet to be fully dealt with for this aspect.

Pricing:
Option 1:  50AUD + post and handling
Option 2:  65AUD + post and handling

Post and handling to ??? would be ???AUD

An important question for the sale of the early units is does the prospect of reflashing firmware concern you?
As you can see there are still some aspects I'm working on, and the web pages need a fair bit of work still.
This requires the Arduino environment to be set up for an ESP32, and a USB to serial adapter.
Over The Air programming using WiFi is also available which makes this a lot easier.

Rest assured the pricing is purely for the hardware.
The software will always be open source and freely available for upgrades and bug fixes.

Thanks again for your interest
Cheers, Ray
