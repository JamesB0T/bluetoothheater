# BluetoothHeater

Bluetooth interface for Chinese Diesel Heaters

Working so far:
* Power On/Off
* Temperature + & -
* Heat exchanger body temperature as reported by heater unit
* Smart error detection, observes unusual heater state progression (ignition fail)
* list to be expanded
* Bluetooth Connectivity
* Bluetooth Control App for Android (Alpha Testing)

To be implemented 
--------------------------
* Wifi control
* MQTT pub/sub 
* Temperature sensing (DS18B20)
* Interface to external screen such as oled or nextion for a full featured controller
* Expand hardware compatability with different MCU setups.  IE Arduino Due/Mega/Pro ESP8266 & ESP32
* Documentation
